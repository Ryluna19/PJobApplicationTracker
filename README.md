# 📋 Job Application Tracker

A full-stack web application that helps users organize and track job applications throughout the hiring process — from application to interview, offer, or rejection.

Built as a portfolio project to demonstrate practical full-stack development skills with React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, JWT authentication, backend validation, automated testing, and REST APIs.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```
Frontend - React
        ↓
REST API - Node.js + Express
        ↓
Authentication and Validation Middleware
        ↓
PostgreSQL Database
```

The project follows a full-stack architecture with separated frontend and backend folders.

The frontend communicates with a REST API. The backend validates requests, authenticates users with JWT, restricts access to user-owned job applications, and communicates with PostgreSQL.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have installed:

* Node.js 20 or newer
* npm
* PostgreSQL
* Git

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Ryluna19/PJobApplicationTracker.git
cd PJobApplicationTracker
```

---

### 2. Create the database

Create a PostgreSQL database named:

```
job_application_tracker
```

You can create it through pgAdmin or by running:

```
CREATE DATABASE job_application_tracker;
```

---

### 3. Create tables and demo data

Open the Query Tool in pgAdmin while connected to the job_application_tracker database.

Run the files below in this order:

```
backend/database/schema.sql
```

Then run:

```
backend/database/seed.sql
```

The schema file creates:

* users table
* jobs table
* foreign key relationship
* database constraints
* status validation
* index for user job searches

The seed file creates a demo account and example job applications.

---

### 4. Backend setup

Go to the backend folder:

```
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a .env file inside the backend folder:

```
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=job_application_tracker
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_PORT=5433

JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
PORT=3000
```

Use the PostgreSQL port configured on your own computer. PostgreSQL commonly uses port 5432, but this project may use 5433 depending on your local installation.

Generate a secure JWT secret with:

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Run the backend server:

```
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### 5. Frontend setup

Open another terminal and go to the frontend folder:

```
cd frontend
npm install
```

Run the frontend:

```
npm run dev
```

The frontend will normally run on:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

## 👤 Demo Account

After running the seed.sql file, use this account to access the application:

```
E-mail: demo@jobtracker.local
Password: demo12345
```

The password is stored in PostgreSQL as a bcrypt hash, not as plain text.

The demo account includes four example applications with all available statuses:

* Applied
* Interview
* Offer
* Rejected

---

## 🧪 Automated Tests

The backend test suite uses Vitest and Supertest.

Tests use a fake PostgreSQL pool, which means they do not access, modify, or delete information from your real database.

Inside the backend folder, run all tests once:

```
npm test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```
npm run test:watch
```

Generate a coverage report:

```
npm run coverage
```

The current backend suite covers:

* API status route
* User registration
* User login
* JWT generation and validation
* Missing, malformed, and invalid tokens
* User validation
* Job validation
* Job CRUD operations
* Job ownership protection
* Database error handling
* Invalid IDs, statuses, and dates

Current backend test coverage:

* Statements: 100%
* Branches: 100%
* Functions: 100%
* Lines: 100%
